Description: 
The user can give the program what size they want the CoolS to be and 
a character that they want to fill the CoolS with. Then, the program prints
out the CoolS. The size must be between 3 and 103 and in the format 4n+3.


Compiling:
The user should be in the pa1 directory. All source files should also be in
the pa1 directory. The "make" command will compile all the files.


Running: 
./pa1 <size> <fillChar> is the command for running the program. Replace
<size> with a number between 3 and 103 increasing by 4, meaning 3, 7, 11,...
And replace <fillChar> with any single character between ascii range of
32 and 126.

Ex) ./pa1 11 o 


Normal output:
Normal output goes to stdout

Ex) ./pa1 3 o
 ^
/o\
\\/
/\\
\o/
 v


Abnormal output:
Abnormal output goes to stderr

Ex) ./pa1 1
Usage: ./pa1 size fillChar
  size: equal to the maximum width of the Cool S
    -- must be in the interval [3, 103]
    -- must be of the form (size = 4n + 3)
    	where n is some integer
  fillChar: used for filling in the Cool S
    -- must be a single character
    -- must be within the ASCII range [32, 126]

Ex) ./pa1 300 b
Error: size must be an integer of the format 4n + 3


Testing:
I tested all the milestone functions to make sure that when an error occurred,
the proper return value was returned and that they worked the way they are 
supposed to. 

Usage: ./pa1 size fillChar
  size: equal to the maximum width of the Cool S
    -- must be in the interval [3, 103]
    -- must be of the form (size = 4n + 3)
    	where n is some integer
  fillChar: used for filling in the Cool S
    -- must be a single character
    -- must be within the ASCII range [32, 126]
I tested that this error would be returned if the user did not provide
2 arguments and then, I tested that the proper error would be shown
when each of the above requirements were not met.



README Questions:

1. line 17, the spacing is slightly different
   line 49, average3V1.s has a tab at the beginning of the line while average3V3.s does not
   line 59, average3V3.s has a line 59 while average3V1.s does not

2. *x = *x * *x

3. argc will be 6 because it stands for argument count and the command
has 6 arguments

4. 
a) dd
b) ndd

5. 
a) yy
b) p

6.
a) :set nu
b) :set nonu

7.

16. I made sure to list all my sources of help and only used allowed sources
of help
