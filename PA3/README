Description:
The program reads in data from a directory and keeps track of how many of each
word are in each decade. The user can input cammands to print a plot or a data
table.


Compiling:
User should be in pa3 directory where all source files are.
Use 'make pa3' to compile program


Running:
./pa3 [-n numSlots] [-s size] [-h]

Command line args are optional. The first arg is to specify the number of slots,
the second is to specify the size of the files, and the third is to show the 
the usage statement. Number of slots defaults to 11. File size defaults to 50.

Ex) ./pa3 -n 30


Normal output:
Normal output goes to stdout

Ex) ./pa3
Commands:
	plot	word -- Display a plot showing a word's popularity over time.
	data 	word -- List word occurrences by decade for a word
	help	     -- Display the message


Abnormal output:
If user enters command that is invalid or uses wrong number of args, program 
prints error message to stdout.

Ex) ./pa3 420

	Extra argument '420' encountered.


Testing:
I tested that all the writeup examples worked and that all the error statements
printer when there were errors.
