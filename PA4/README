Description:
The user can search through files for certain patterns using the different
flags.


Compiling:
User must be in pa4 directory where all the sources files are located.
Use the command 'make mygrep' to compile program


Running:
Use './mygrep' to run program

./mygrep [flags] [pattern] [file]

Flag are optional:
"-i"/"--ignore-case" ignores cases and prints out lines that match pattern
"-v"/"--invert-match prints out lines that do not match pattern 
"-n"/"--line-number" prints out lines that match pattern with line number 
"-c"/"--count" prints out how many times that pattern appears in file(s), 
"--help" prints out the usage statement
"-e"/"regexp" allows user to change up where they put the pattern when inputting

pattern is required

files are optional and user can use as many as they want

ex)
./mygrep -n hello file1
1: HELLO WORLD


Normal output:
normal output goes to stdout

ex) ./mygrep -c hello file1
1


Abnormal output:
abnormal output goes to stderr

ex) ./mygrep -e
./mygrep: option requires an argument -- 'e'



Testing:
I tested all the error and normal tests from the writeup and made sure all the 
error statements worked and checked more test cases with the example program




1. :%s/early/often/g

2. command > file	( > redirects output of command into file )
   command1 | command2	( | redirects the output of command1 to become arg of 
   			command2)

3. malloc - takes 1 arg, the size of memory that it needs to allocated and it
	doesn't initialize the memory so the memory holds garbage values
   calloc - takes 2 args, the number of memory blocks and the size of each block
   	that it needs to allocate and it initializes the memory to 0 after 
	allocating it
   realloc - takes 2 args, the pointer to the memory that needs to be 
   	reallocated and the new size of the block of memory. It creates a new 
	block of memory that is the size specified and copies everything from 
	the old memory block to the new one. Then, it frees the old piece of
	memory and sets the pointer to point at the new block of memory.

4. Respect, honesty, and fairness. I know that I earned the grade that I got
which makes me feel proud of my achievements.
